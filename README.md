## An Innovative and Efficient Digital Asset Management System

### Problem It Solves

Universities often face challenges when it comes to effectively sharing digital educational resources across different sections and departments. The digital notes provided by teachers may not reach all students due to the large number of students in a university or an educational institute. For a university, it is a common scenario that there might be thousands of students registered for a course and studying the same subject. They are divided into groups/sections for ease of study, and many teachers may be teaching that subject to a chunk of students. The problem arises: What about that one student in a section? How much study material is he getting? The answer is one. He will receive study materials only from his class teacher, regardless of having 10+ teachers with 10 different teaching styles. To address this, I've developed a user-friendly resource-sharing platform that can greatly enhance the teaching and learning experience.

### What It Offers

**Organizations**: Think of these as online communities where students and faculties can come together. By joining (members authorized by the org) an organization, one can receive updates and gain access to shared resources of that organization.

**Topics**: We've introduced "topics" to help categorize resources of an organization. For example, if a teacher wants to share Python lectures, they can find the "Python" topic within the university's organization and upload their lectures there.

**Posts**: Any authorized user of that organization holding upload access can post any resource under a topic. Posts usually contain a title and the files (any type). Other users of that organization can view the post, read documents inside it, and share their thoughts by commenting and voting on that post.

### Unique Feature

**Document Viewer**: A document viewer is attached to the platform that supports 20+ document types, including ppt, doc, xlsx, pdf, csv, etc. This eliminates the need for downloading any resource from the platform, meaning a faculty can present a document fully online without having to download it locally. A student can read any study material from his university online.

**Authorized Only Access**: This feature keeps an organization's data protected from the outside world. An organization admin and its maintainers will decide who can view their resources. By default, private organization data is only accessible by its members. Admin and maintainers can also restrict access to some crucial data from ordinary members by setting a unique access role for a document or a topic. This feature can reduce data leaking by the organization members as there is no download and share. So even a confidential document can be securely stored and distributed to its potential viewers.

### Benefits for Students

- Students can access a wide range of learning materials, including Python lectures from various faculty members, allowing them to choose the resources that suit their learning style.
- It eliminates the need for students to search for learning materials outside the university, making all the resources they need available within the institution.
- Regardless of their section or assigned teacher, all students can access high-quality educational content, promoting a competitive and enriched academic environment.

### Benefits for Faculty

- The platform encourages better communication among faculty members, facilitating the exchange of knowledge and resources.
- A special feature allows teachers to present lectures and content during classes without the need to download resources.
- Faculty members can access course materials online, even if they don't have the files stored locally, ensuring uninterrupted teaching.

## How to Use it
